# oneTwoOne
A simple extension to prevent students from using other 1:1 Chromebooks

Credit goes to jay0lee for the original application, and to Matt Henry for his forked version which served as the basis for this version. You can find the original code at (https://github.com/jay0lee/oneTwoOne/, https://github.com/matthttam/oneTwoOne).

# Early Testing Guide
__WARNING__: The current version of this extension is customized for our specific district however it can still work just fine for others. Also, be sure to only deploy it to students.

### Populate the location attribute of Chrome devices with comma separated list of allowed user logins.

A few examples:

Limit device to one user account:
```
Location: rgeorge6549@acme.edu
```
allow the following three students to use the device
```
Location: jsmith7877@acme.edu,tgregg4343@acme.edu,fscott2498@acme.edu
```
We don't really care what else is in the field as long as the email and comma are there:
```
Location: George Washington High,pswanson0937@acme.edu
```
Wildcard * allows any user for lab devices:
```
Location: *

Location: 4th grade lab rm122,*
```
if Location is empty, the device is unmanaged, the device is managed by another G Suite instance or the extension is running on a non-Chrome OS platform (Windows/Mac/Linux) then the extension should allow regular access.

### Force the extension to students who should be locked down
If teachers don't get the extension, they'll be able to login to any device.
1. admin.google.com > 3 bar menu at top left > Devices > Chrome management > Apps & extensions
1. Choose student testing OU to the left.
1. Yellow + circle at bottom right > yellow "grid" icon with tooltip "add Chrome app or extension by ID".
1. Extension ID: ``````
1. Click save. Now in the list of extensions change `````` from "Allow install" to "Force install". Click save at top right.

### Things to test
- It can take a while for changes to device location attribute to reach the device. Go to chrome://policy and force a refresh to speed up testing.
- Confirm student listed in location is able to login and access websites as usual.
- Confirm student not listed in location gets a popup on login and gets redirected to block page when browsing web.
- Confirm teacher and admin accounts that don't get the extension force installed won't be locked out of any device.
- You can get details about what the extension is doing in the extension console. chrome://extensions > OneTwoOne > background page > console tab. You'll want to allow devtools for force installed extensions while testing but block it in production to keep students from being able to kill the extension.
- The extension is currently comparing the user's email address against the device's location attribute because both of these attributes can be read by the extension _without Internet access_. This means students can't do a timed disconnect of Internet in order to break the extension. Future versions may support mapping students to devices with other fields.
